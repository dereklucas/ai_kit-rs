Run `cargo test fplan_tests::plan_iterator_tests::test_plan_iterator`

Questions:
    Why is `create_subgoals` only running once?
        @ A complete plan is not being generated!  The root goal only has one layer of subgoals
            Why?
                @ satisfied is returning Some value for incomplete goal trees!
                    MOTHERFUCKER!

Idea:
    Test satisfaction on shallower goal hierarchy
        Such as where the root is (current-state 2 ?t)
