Run `cargo test fplan_tests::plan_iterator_tests::test_plan_iterator`

Questions:
    Why is `create_subgoals` only running once?
    It appears that bindings linking goals and subgoals are not being ran.
    Why are `bindings_at_creation` time not being set?
    How to incorporate `bindings_at_creation_time`
